some neural network goodies 
there are several mini projects that i solve in this repo 

 
you can follow this project subject below: 
* dir 3 is modeling linear discreet system using neural networks
* dir 4 try to calculate PCA ( principal components analisys) usinf nueral nets in two diffrent ways
* dir 5 clustering using NN  
* dir 6 is coloring pics whith an autoencoder ( fruit dataset)
* dir 7 Variational autoencoder
* dir 8 ECG heartbeat classification and a comparison between LSTMs and RNNs
* dir 9 attention heatmaps

 ## there is a pdf guide written in farsi in this repo
